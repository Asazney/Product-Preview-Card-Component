# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Product preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

I found out about the pseudo-class root. Instead of copying and pasting colors over and over again, we can just put them in a variable and reuse the var() value throughout the stylesheet.

:root {
    --white:#ffffff;
    --darkgrey:#747682;
    --mediumlightgrey:#707176;
    --darkgreen:#3D8168;
